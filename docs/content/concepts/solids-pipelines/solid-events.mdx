# Solid Events

While a solid is being executed, it can communicate with the Dagster framework either by yielding an event, or raising an exception. This page describes all of these options.

## Overview

Solids yield a stream of structured events, consisting of several different types.

However, there are several other types of events that might be useful to emit, which provide functionality for describing assets, indicating failures, and performing data/type checks.

## Events

Yielding events from within the body of a solid is a useful way of communicating with the Dagster framework. The most critical event to the functionality of Dagster is the <PyObject object="Output"/> event, which allows output data to be passed on from one solid to the next. However, sometimes you will want to

### Event Metadata

Oftentimes, it may be useful to attach some arbitrary information to an event that is not captured by its basic parameters. Through the <PyObject object="EventMetadataEntry"/> object, we provide a consistent interface for specifying this metadata on a variety of events. Depending on the type of the data, these entries will be rendered in Dagit in a more useful format than a simple unstructured string.

Both AssetMaterialization and ExpectationResult events accept a `metadata_entries` parameter, which is simply a list of these objects.

We provide support for a wide variety of potentially useful metadata types, including simple datatypes (EventMetadataEntry.float, EventMetadataEntry.int, EventMetadataEntry.text), as well as more complex information such as markdown and json (EventMetadataEntry.md, EventMetadataEntry.json).

Check out the API Docs for EventMetadataEntry here for a complete list.

### Outputs

To return an output from a solid, simply yield an <PyObject object="Output"/> event:

```python file=/concepts/solids_pipelines/solid_events.py startafter=start_solid_output_0 endbefore=end_solid_output_0
@solid
def my_yield_solid(context):
    yield Output(1)
```

Many solids yield only one output, like the example above. Returning a single value from a solid's `compute_fn` is equivalent to yielding a single <PyObject object="Output"/> event with the default output name "result". For example:

```python file=/concepts/solids_pipelines/solid_events.py startafter=start_solid_output_1 endbefore=end_solid_output_1
@solid
def return_solid(context):
    return 1
```

Is equivalent to

```python file=/concepts/solids_pipelines/solid_events.py startafter=start_solid_output_2 endbefore=end_solid_output_2
@solid
def yield_solid(context):
    yield Output(1, "result")
```

### Asset Materializations

### Expectation Results

Solids can emit structured events to represent the results of a data quality test. The data quality event class is the <PyObject object="ExpectationResult" />. To generate an expectation result, we can yield an <PyObject object="ExpectationResult" /> event in our solid.

```python
@solid
def my_expectation_solid(context, df):
    do_some_transform(df)
    yield ExpectationResult(success=len(df) > 0, description="ensure dataframe has rows")
    yield Output(df)
```

#### Attaching Metadata to Expectation Results

Like many other event types in Dagster, there are a variety of types of metadata that can be associated with an expectation result event, all through the <PyObject object="EventMetadataEntry"/> class. Each expectation event optionally takes a list of metadata entries that are then displayed in the event log.

This example shows metadata entries of different types attached to the same expectation result:

```python file=/concepts/solids_pipelines/solid_events.py startafter=start_metadata_expectation_solid endbefore=end_metadata_expectation_solid
@solid
def my_metadata_expectation_solid(context, df):
    do_some_transform(df)
    yield ExpectationResult(
        success=len(df) > 0,
        description="ensure dataframe has rows",
        metadata_entries=[
            EventMetadataEntry.text("Text-based metadata for this event", label="text_metadata"),
            EventMetadataEntry.url("http://mycoolsite.com/url_for_my_data", label="dashboard_url"),
            EventMetadataEntry.float(1.0 * len(df), "row count"),
            EventMetadataEntry.float(calculate_bytes(df), "size (bytes)"),
        ],
    )
    yield Output(df)
```
